These are the datasets used in  the experiments illustrated
in the IROS and Autonomous Robots papers.

The files intel.txt and robotXX.txt have been built from the
intel_lab and ap_hill datasets available on radish.sourceforge.net.
Other datasets were collected at UC Merced. If you use them,
please cite the above papers.

Maps are encoded using the default values used for the
grid_map class (see documentation therein).

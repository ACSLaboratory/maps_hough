Computes the Hough transform using a randomized approch. This is one of the improvements described
in the IROS 2008 paper.

Computes the Hough transform using a deterministic approach. This is the basic method described in the
Autonomous Robots 2008 paper.

@param v vector of points with  occupied cells coordinates

@hough_increment determines how many points will be deterministically ignored. With 1 all points will be
taken, with 2 every second point will be taken (first, third, etc), with 3 every third point and so on.
Useful to speed up the computation but with an obvious tradeoff with accuracy.

Extracts prjections along the axis in an improved way as described in the IROS 2008 paper. 
Note that this function processes a vector of points rather than a map, so the dimensions of the map
should be passed as additional parameters.

prescribed by direction. Resul is normalized at the end (i.e. in the range 0-1)
@param p vector of coordinates of occupied points
@param direction specifies the direction along which the projections should be computed. If 'X' or 'x' it will project alon the columns. Any other value will project along the rows.
@param r number of row in the original map 
@param c number of columns in the original map
@param increment
@param randomized specifies whether a radomized computation should be computed or not (defaults to false)
@param fraction fraction of points to be considered in the randomized case (defaults to 1)
